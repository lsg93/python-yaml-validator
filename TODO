goal is taking some rules in a yaml, then using those rules to validate another yaml


Validation steps :
Initialize the Registry (load all available Rule classes).

Pass the Registry into the Validator.

Run the Validator (it uses the Registry as a lookup table).


- Rules. Rules should be a registry for individual Rule classes.

- People should be able to add their own 'rules' somehow - maybe using the multidoc functionality to point to where extra rules are, or as a pypi package

Pass file from loader to a Custom Type that checks file is valid yaml, then reads it into a "data" property

Refactor main test to be a class, with create_config as fixture (auto use maybe?)
Make thing take two args and test it.

TODO

- Clean up implementation of mocks in rule_registry test. Probably no need for 3 mocks - could be one customisable one.

Start working on validator integration tests. Will need a "fake" rule that actually exists, and maybe a fake package - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79386183/how-can-i-test-that-python-package-entrypoints-are-correctly-discovered-and-load
